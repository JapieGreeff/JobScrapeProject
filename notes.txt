MS SQL is used as my generic SQL - to fix this
ORACLE sql extention should be added and reviewed
locations should be cleaned up as well
Where a technology version is specified the core technology is chosen
No Tensorflow, but positions like "machine learning engineer" are there and not specified
remote positions are kept, but positions for emigration are removed
ABAP covers BAPI and ABAP OO programming
positions marked as copies removed
